 * 1. Two types of encryption ?
 * 
 * Symmetric & Asymmetric encryption
 * 
 * Symmetric - encryption where same keys are use to encrypt & decrypt.
 * 
 * Asymmetric - it is a key pair encrytion , where public & private keys 
 *              used to encrypt & decrypt.
 *              Public key is used to encrypt the message/data and private key is 
 *              used to decrypt the message.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Encryption vs Hashing
 *      Both job is to secure password.
 * 
 * Encryption - can encode message & decode message
 * We can encode and decode text, eg. aman(encode) -> udhwjmn(decode) -> aman
 *      
 * Hashing - One way communication 
 * eg. aman -> anmnjkfhdkf.dsofuewn.oiutshd    
 * 
 *

 * 
 * 2. Hoisting ?
 *    see file 2_hoisting_in_js.js
 * 
 * 3. Authentication & Authorization ?
 * 
 * -  Authentication is a process where users validate themselves,
 *    eg: Username & password
 *        one time password 
 *        fingerprints
 * -  Authorization is a process where special permission grant to user and limited resources
 *    are alotted to user. Also known as access control or client proviledges.
 *    eg: Adding a user in group, giving admin rights to user.
 * 
 * In secure environements, authorization must always follows authentication. Eg. In HCL , i proved 
 * my identity first (Authentication) then i got priviedges to access the applications (Authorization).
